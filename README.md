# wadv
A python script that pulls weather advisories from http://alerts.weather.gov
and displays it in the terminal.

At this point the script doesn't do anything other than display if there's an
advisory or not and the time the information has been updated. Miami-Dade
county is hard coded into the script. This can be changed by replacing the
county code with your location (http://alerts.weather.gov/).
